# coin_comparer

This cointains code for the coin comparer: A quick and dirty leaflet and datables mashup to enable the comparison and cataloging of images. You will need to have a postgre sql database installed, as well as some form of image storage - this can be local or over the web, depending on your preference.

This is very much a hackable project, with modifications and improvements welcome!
